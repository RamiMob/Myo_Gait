# Myo_Gait
The goal of this project is to provide an accessible platform for developing myoelectric driven gait phases recognition schemes. The code is designed to be modular, allowing users to easily test different feature sets, learning models, and postprocessors to allow researchers to contribute in further boosting the state-of-art performances.
